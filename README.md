# spaceships

## Intro

main C++ file with a simple game loop. This code initializes a window and lets a spaceship move around. I might expand it to include collision detection, more entities like planets and stars, and sound effects.

### Tools

c++, a Makefile to compile and link the SFML libraries.

### Purpose

Learn a cool programming language, encourage my children to be creators and build their own games and programs.
