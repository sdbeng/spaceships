# spaceships

## Intro

main C++ file with a simple game loop. This code initializes a window and lets a spaceship move around. I might expand it to include collision detection, more entities like planets and stars, and sound effects.

### Tools

c++, a Makefile to compile and link the SFML libraries.

### exec

compile first, fix errors if any, then run clang++:

```c++
make ./spaceship_game
./spaceship_game
```

### Purpose

Learn a cool programming language, encourage my children to be creators and build their own games and programs.

### Resources - Attributions

Thanks to pixabay creators for letting us use their cool sound effects (sound effect from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=music&utm_content=14562)), as well as the free png images from vectorize.

### Contribute

New ideas are welcome, open to discussion and improvements to runtime, size of resources, etc., to make it more fun. In the next version, if possible, package game then insert it into another platform to keep up the score or progress on different things like, study streaks, hackathons, etc.
